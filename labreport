**Researching Commands**
 - Chosen Command is (grep).
 
 - grep command is in command line searches for words in a file . 
 
 - -i
 The command line -i option is a kind of a command line option that ignores the case sensitivity when searching of a pattren. 
 This command line is helpful when you want to search something in a file, and you want all the words in lower and upper case. Because this command line
 will not distinguish between uppercase and lowecase. 
 - For example, in the screenshot below, i wanted to look for the word history in the HistoryJapan.txt file, and as we can see that i wrote the history 
 with all loswecases, but it did show the uppercase words of History. 
 
 - Using -i the command-line and its output Example 1:
 
  ````
 ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -i "history" HistoryJapan.txt 
        A Brief History
        Prehistory and Early Chronicles
        of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and

  - Using -i the command-line and its output Example 2:

  In this example, I wanted to look up the sentance in the txt file, howeever, I was not sure if the sentance is written in an uppercase letters or
  lowercases, so I just wrote the sentance I remember, and it gave me where the sentance did appear and how it is actuallu written. 
  
 - This is very useful because it saves time to go over the whole text to exatcly match how the sentance or word was written to search it. 
 
 
 
 - -c 
 This command-line Shows how many a word appeared in a text file, and again it is not a case sensitive, which means I can write a word in lower or upper 
 case, and it will still give me how many times this specific word appeared. 
 
 - Here is a code block of how I wrote the terminal and the output. 
 ````
 ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -c "official" HistoryJapan.txt
 3
````

Here, I wanted to see how many times the word "official" appeared in the text file, and this is helpful again because it saves vso much time, instead
of counting each word in the terminal. 

- -l
This command-line shows where a specific word appeared in differenet files. 

- Here is an example of me trying to find where the word "Official" appeared in so many files. This is helpful because it is fast and it gives you a list
of where the word appeared between so many files. 

````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -l "Official" *.txt
WhatToHongKong.txt
WhereToFrance.txt
WhereToMadrid.txt
`````
The syntax to write the command was ```grep -l "Official" *.txt```, and the output was ```WhatToHongKong.txt WhereToFrance.txt WhereToMadrid.txt ``` which are the files where this word appeared.
